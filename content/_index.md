Welcome to **Sound Samples**: An collection of my recorded sound samples. Currently I use a Tascam(c) DR-05 recorder for my recordings.

Preferably I record nature sounds like
{{% ticks %}}
* Birds
* Sea waves
* Lake shore
* Frogs
* Thunderstorms
{{% /ticks %}}

This site is automatically build from my git repository with a drone pipeline.
